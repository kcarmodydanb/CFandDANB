This is a note keeping file to help with understanding how CF and DANB was able to create modules pertinent to their business process.

We decided that we would follow a naming convention: Schema_Institution_Module_DataDescription, e.g. VW_DANB_EXM_EXAM


#### Schemas
- VW - views




#### Institution
- DANB - Dental Assisting National Board



#### Module
- CUST - Customer
- EXM - Exams
- SBM - Submitals


#### Data Description
- Exams -
- Attribute -
- Submittal -
- Customer -


#### Apex Page Number Designation
 - Submitals 1200 - 1299



###### to do's
- [x] did this work? cmonnnn
- [ ] clean up submittal views in Apex
- [ ] what is certification aps for 1100? Do we want to designate 1100 - 1199 for certification apps?
