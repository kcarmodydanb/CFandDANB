This is a note keeping file to help with understanding how CF and DANB was able to create modules pertinent to their business process.

We decided that we would follow a naming convention: Schema_Institution_Module_DataDescription, e.g. VW_DANB_EXM_EXAM


#### Schemas
- VW - views




#### Institution
- DANB - Dental Assisting National Board



#### Module
- CUST - Customer
- EXM - Exams
- SBM - Submitals


#### Data Description
- Exams -
- Attribute -
- Submittal -
- Customer -


### Apex Number Designation
 - Submitals 1200 - 1299
 -


## to do's
